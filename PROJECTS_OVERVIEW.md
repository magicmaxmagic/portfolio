# PROJECTS OVERVIEW PAGE

## My Approach to Building & Shipping ML Systems

I choose projects where I own the full problem—from defining what matters, through modeling, to shipping something that works. I focus on work that either:

1. **Moves a business metric** – Attribution models that improve budget allocation, NLP systems that uncover customer insights
2. **Solves a hard technical problem** – Building robust inference pipelines, optimizing for inference latency, handling production data quality issues
3. **Teaches me something new** – Each project should expand what I can do in production ML

I document what I learned: the dead ends, the trade-offs, the gotchas. Not just the wins.

## Projects at a Glance

### Featured Projects

**1. Marketing Attribution & MMM at Scale – Ubisoft**
*Data Science / MLOps / Causal Inference*

Designed end-to-end attribution modeling pipeline for marketing analytics. Combined Markov chains, removal effect, and Bayesian MMM. Shipped statistical models through Snowflake → Databricks → Metaflow → MLflow. Enabled more intelligent marketing spend allocation across channels.

**2. Medical NLP – Named Entity Recognition on MedMentions**
*NLP / Data Engineering / Hyperparameter Optimization*

Built NER system for medical text (MedMentions dataset). Compared BERT and GPT-Neo. Optimized hyperparameters with Optuna at scale. Tackled annotation challenges and model error analysis. Shipped as reproducible training pipeline.

**3. Text Clustering & Voice of Customer Analysis**
*NLP / Embeddings / Unsupervised Learning*

Deployed text clustering pipeline for customer feedback. Used Sentence-Transformers for embeddings, HDBSCAN for clustering, UMAP for visualization. Extracted actionable insights from unstructured feedback. Built monitoring for embedding drift.

**4. Prevent – SaaS for Automated Web Vulnerability Detection**
*Product / Full-Stack ML / Entrepreneurship*

Co-founded SaaS product for automated vulnerability scanning. Designed security vulnerability detection ML system. Integrated Stripe for payments. Learned hard lessons about product positioning, customer discovery, and the pivot from scanning to prevention-focused automation.

## How Projects Are Organized

- **Full case studies** for each project with problem context, technical decisions, and learnings
- **Decision transparency** – why I chose certain approaches, what I traded off
- **Emphasis on shipping** – this isn't academic. These are systems I built and deployed.
- **Real constraints** – data limitations, latency budgets, cost, team size

Navigate to any project to understand the full scope, the decisions I made, and what I'd do differently.
