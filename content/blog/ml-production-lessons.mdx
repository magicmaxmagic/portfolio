# Building Production ML Systems

Production ML is different from experimentation. Here's what I've learned.

## The Gap Between Research and Production

Most ML tutorials show the happy path: train a model, get validation scores, celebrate. Real production is messier.

### Key Differences

1. **Data Quality Matters More Than Algorithm**
   - A simple model on clean data > complex model on dirty data
   - Invest in data pipelines first

2. **Reproducibility is Non-Negotiable**
   - Version everything: data, code, models, parameters
   - Your future self (and your team) will thank you

3. **Monitoring > Accuracy**
   - Production accuracy != validation accuracy
   - Track data drift, model drift, business metrics

## Practical Lessons

### Start Simple

The best production ML systems I've built started with simple baselines:
- Linear regressions
- Decision trees  
- Heuristics

Only optimize when you have data that justifies the complexity.

### Think in Pipelines

```python
# Not this:
model = train_model(X, y)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Think this:
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("preprocessor", Preprocessor()),
    ("feature_engineering", FeatureEngineer()),
    ("model", Model()),
    ("postprocessor", Postprocessor()),
])
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

### Version Your Decisions

Every production model has implicit assumptions. Document them:
- Why this algorithm?
- Why these features?
- Why this threshold?

Future you will be grateful.

## Conclusion

Build for operations, not for papers. Your ML system's value is in production, not in validation scores.
