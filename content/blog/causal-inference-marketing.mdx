# Causal Inference in Marketing

Why does correlation mislead us in marketing, and how to think causally.

## The Correlation Problem

Your email campaign had high open rates. Did emails **cause** conversions, or were engaged users more likely to open emails AND convert anyway?

This is the fundamental problem of causal inference.

## Simpson's Paradox in Action

```
Overall: Email campaigns improve conversion by 20%

By segment:
- New users: Email campaigns DECREASE conversion by 5%  
- Existing users: Email campaigns DECREASE conversion by 3%

How is overall positive??
→ More existing users in email campaigns (they convert more anyway)
```

## Practical Approaches

### 1. Randomized Control Trials (Gold Standard)

**Pros:** No confounding, clear causality
**Cons:** Expensive, can't test everything, ethical concerns

```python
# A/B test framework
def run_ab_test(control_group, treatment_group):
    control_conversion = calculate_conversion(control_group)
    treatment_conversion = calculate_conversion(treatment_group)
    
    # If truly random assignment:
    causal_effect = treatment_conversion - control_conversion
    return causal_effect
```

### 2. Observational Methods

When you can't randomize:

- **Propensity Score Matching:** Match users on observable characteristics
- **Instrumental Variables:** Use exogenous variation
- **Regression Discontinuity:** Exploit threshold effects
- **Difference-in-Differences:** Compare changes over time

### 3. Think About Your Assumptions

Every causal claim requires assumptions:
- No unmeasured confounders
- Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)
- Consistency

State them explicitly.

## For Marketing Teams

**Stop saying:** "This campaign has high ROI"
**Start saying:** "Based on this RCT, we estimate causal effect at..."

Small shift in language, massive shift in decision quality.
