## Let's Work Together

I'm open to conversations about:
- Applied ML roles (Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Applied Scientist, Senior Data Scientist)
- Companies solving hard technical problems at scale
- Challenges in causal inference, MLOps, or production systems
- Early-stage ventures solving real problems (I've been there)

I'm particularly interested in roles where:
- Impact is measurable and business-driven
- The full ML stack matters (data engineering through deployment)
- Teams think in systems, not just models
- There's room to learn something new

## What To Include

If you're reaching out about a role or collaboration, a few things help:

1. **The problem you're solving.** What's the business context? Why does it matter?
2. **Your team & structure.** Who would I work with? What's the organizational setup?
3. **What success looks like.** How will we measure if the project succeeded?
4. **Timeline & scope.** Are we talking about a 3-month sprint or a 2-year build?

This helps me quickly assess fit. I'm a poor culture-fit for some roles (and that's okay). Better to know early.

## Closing

I build systems that work. I think in trade-offs. I communicate clearly. And I care deeply about shipping something that matters.

If that resonates, let's talk.
