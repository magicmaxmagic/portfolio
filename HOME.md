## Hero Section

**Headline:**
Applied ML systems that drive business decisions.

**Subheadline:**
Data Scientist & ML Engineer building end-to-end machine learning infrastructure for marketing attribution, NLP, and production systems.

**Short Intro:**
I work on the full ML stack—from problem definition through production deployment. I've shipped attribution models at Ubisoft, built NLP systems for medical text analysis, and launched a SaaS vulnerability detection product. I care about measurable business impact, sound statistical reasoning, and systems that scale.

## Value Proposition – What Differentiates Me

**Decision-Oriented Modeling**
I don't build models for accuracy metrics. I build models that answer specific business questions and drive decisions. Every project starts with: "What decision does this enable?"

**End-to-End Ownership**
From data engineering through MLOps, I own the full pipeline. That means I understand constraints, trade-offs, and where technical debt lives.

**Production Sensibility**
I've shipped systems to production at scale. I think about monitoring, versioning, reproducibility, and the cost of retraining—not just model performance on holdout sets.

## 3 Core Expertise Pillars

**1. Marketing Attribution & Causal Measurement**
Shipped marketing attribution models (Markov chains, removal effect, Bayesian MMM) at Ubisoft. Built data pipelines from raw marketing channels through statistical inference. Understand the math and the business friction of real-world attribution.

**2. Machine Learning Operations at Scale**
Proficient with Metaflow, MLflow, Databricks, and Snowflake. Have designed reproducible training pipelines, model registries, and CI/CD for ML systems. Know how to instrument, monitor, and operate models in production.

**3. Applied NLP & Text Analysis**
Built NER systems on biomedical text (MedMentions, HuggingFace), optimized hyperparameters with Optuna, and shipped clustering pipelines for voice-of-customer analysis. Hands-on with transformer architectures, tokenization, and embedding strategies.

## Credibility Section – Experience Highlights

**Data Scientist Intern, Ubisoft** — Marketing Analytics & Attribution
Designed and deployed marketing attribution models using Markov chains and Bayesian methods. Built ETL pipelines in Snowflake and orchestrated training workflows on Databricks with Metaflow. Presented findings to product and business teams; recommendations shaped marketing spend allocation.

**MLOps Infrastructure** — Production Systems
Shipped models through complete lifecycle: versioning, training, validation, deployment. Experienced with experiment tracking (W&B, MLflow), feature stores, and model monitoring. Built CI/CD pipelines for reproducible, auditable model updates.

**NLP & Text Understanding** — Medical & Customer Insights
Built named entity recognition on MedMentions dataset using transformer-based models. Optimized hyperparameters at scale. Applied text clustering and embeddings (Sentence-Transformers, HDBSCAN, UMAP) for customer feedback analysis.

**Entrepreneurial ML** — Prevent (SaaS for Web Vulnerability Detection)
Co-founded and shipped a SaaS product. Handled product strategy, ML architecture, backend infrastructure, and payment integration (Stripe). Learned hard lessons about product-market fit, customer feedback, and when to pivot.

## Tone Notes
- Confident but not arrogant
- Technical but accessible to senior non-ML stakeholders
- Business-focused (impact over vanity metrics)
- No overuse of ML jargon
