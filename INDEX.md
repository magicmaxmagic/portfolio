# Maxence Le Gendre – Applied ML & Data Science Portfolio

## Professional ML Systems Builder

I build end-to-end machine learning systems that move business metrics. Experienced with marketing attribution, NLP, MLOps, and full-stack product development.

**Current focus:** Applied ML roles at companies solving hard technical problems at scale—causal inference, production systems, decision-oriented modeling.

## Key Themes Across My Work

**1. Decision-Oriented Modeling**
Every model I build answers a specific business question. I start with "What decision does this enable?" not "How high can we push F1?"

**2. End-to-End Systems**
I own the full ML lifecycle: problem definition → data engineering → modeling → deployment → monitoring. I understand constraints at every layer.

**3. Production Sensibility**
I think about reproducibility, monitoring, cost, and operational burden. A beautiful model that breaks in production is worthless.

**4. Real Constraints**
I work with messy data, class imbalance, distribution shift, and limited compute. My systems handle the gap between theory and reality.

**5. Honest About Trade-offs**
I document what I optimized for, what I sacrificed, and why. No perfect models. Just defensible choices.

## What I'm Looking For

- Applied ML roles where impact is measurable (not vanity metrics)
- Companies solving hard problems at scale (millions of predictions, real constraints)
- Teams that care about the full ML stack (data engineering, MLOps, deployment)
- Continuous learning: new domains, new challenges, room to think deeply

## How to Read This Portfolio

**If you have 10 minutes:**
Read the [Home Page](./HOME.md) and [About](./ABOUT.md).

**If you have 30 minutes:**
Read the Home Page, [Projects Overview](./PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md), and one detailed case study (start with [Ubisoft Attribution](./PROJECT_ATTRIBUTION_MMM.md) if you care about causal inference, or [Medical NLP](./PROJECT_MEDICAL_NER.md) if you care about deep learning).

**If you have an hour:**
Read everything. Start with the [Home Page](./HOME.md), skim the [Projects Overview](./PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md), then dive into 2-3 case studies that match your interests.

**If you want to understand my thinking:**
Read [About](./ABOUT.md) + [Tech Stack](./TECH_STACK.md). This tells you how I approach problems and what tools I use to solve them.
